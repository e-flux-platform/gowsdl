- datetime fields are not native datetime objects, and there are also different ones LocalDateTimeType/DateTimeType/soap.XSDDateTime
- XMLName fields everywhere
- request is always a struct with pointers, even though if only 0-1 fields
- split between normal and live service
- EOF errors should have more info
- restriction becomes plain string or int, instead of using idomatic Go enum(ish) types
- check if result always needed
